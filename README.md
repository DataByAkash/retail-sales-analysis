# 🛒 Retail Sales Analysis (Python Project)

This is a **Retail Sales Analysis and Inventory Management System** developed using Python. The system allows users to add menu items, update inventory, view sales summaries, and analyze sales performance all through a simple menu-driven interface.

## 🧠 What I Learned

During this project, I improved my understanding of:

- **Dictionaries and Lists in Python**: to store structured data (menu items with multiple attributes)
- **String formatting and display logic**: for clean console output
- **Functions and Modular Design**: keeping code clean and readable
- **Sorting with `lambda`**: for analyzing sales and ranking items
- **Nested control flow**: handling user input and matching items correctly

## 🧑‍💻 How It Works

1. **Main Menu**: Continuously loops until the user chooses to quit
2. **Add Item**: Adds an item with name, category, price, and quantity to the menu
3. **Update Quantity**: Finds an item by name and updates its quantity
4. **Sales Summary**: Displays all items with calculated total sales
5. **Sales Analysis**: Lists items sorted by total revenue (price × quantity)
